            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar pickle slices</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups fine cornmeal</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>

            <li>Pour the flour, cornmeal, seafood seasoning, and 1/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning into a large, resealable plastic bag; shake to mix well. Add pickles a few at a time and tumble gently to coat evenly with the flour mixture. Remove and place on prepared plate.</li>

            <li>Fry pickles in several batches until golden brown and slightly crisp on the outside with a moist interior, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine buttermilk ranch dressing with 1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning; blend. Serve as a dipping sauce for warm pickles.</li>
